# Goodanimemes-Rules
These are the current, definitive, r/goodanimemes rules.

Why use this repo instead of reddit?

--It makes it easier for us to keep track of suggestions and discussions

--It gurantees that we will see you

To make suggestions create a issue, and discuss. *Yoink people from reddit to here*.

To make grammatical corrections or sections to the rules, create a pull request.
